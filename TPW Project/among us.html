<p>This is the staff team, now I am going to be explaining what mod does what job</p>
  <br>
<p>Lobon moderates chat and makes sure that everything is okay</p>
<br>
<p>Azee is very active and she also moderates the chat with lobon</p>
<br>
<p>Rai is the one that stops raids and is a undercover spy</p>
<br>
<p>Ahsan is the one that does nothing but I made him a mod because he likes Jeylin kotha shesh</p>
<br>
<p>Aiman and Abrar are the ones who setup the server and does most of the work</p>
